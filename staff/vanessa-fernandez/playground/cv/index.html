                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p> Hi! I'm Homer J. Simpson — lover of couches, cold beer, and well-deserved naps. I've been working for years as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant (and nothing major has exploded... yet!). I'm a professional with extensive experience in making quick decisions, especially when donuts are involved. While I may not always take the most logical path, I usually end up somewhere... eventually. I'm looking for new opportunities where I can apply my unique talents — like sleeping with my eyes open, solving problems without moving too much, and keeping a good mood no matter what.</p>
